I [D]know I stand in line until you think 
you have the time to spend an [Em]evening with [A]me.  [Em]  [A]
And [Em]if we go some[A]place to dance I [Em]know that
there's a [A]chance you won't be [D]leaving with me.
And [D7]afterwards we drop into a quiet little place 
And have a [G]drink or two  [Bb]
And [Em]then I go and [A]spoil it all by [Em]saying
Something [Am]stupid, like I [D]love you.

I can [D7]see it in your eyes that you despise 
The same old lines you heard the [G]night before.
And [E]though it's just a line to you, for [E7]me it's true
And never seemed so [A]right before.  [A7]

I [D]practice everyday to find some clever lines
To say to make the [Em]meaning come [A]true.  [Em]  [A]
But [Em]then I think I'll [A]wait until the [Em]evening 
gets [A]late And I'm [D]alone with you.
The [D7]time is right your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the [G]night's so blue.  [Bb]
And [Em]then I go and [A]spoil it all by [Em]saying
Something [A7]stupid like I [D]love you.

{c:Instrumental}
D  Em  A  Em  A
Em  A  Em  A  D

The [D7]time is right your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the [G]night's so blue.  [Bb]
And [Em]then I go and [A]spoil it all by [Em]saying
Something [A7]stupid like I [D]love you.

I [D]love you. [Bb]  (x3)
