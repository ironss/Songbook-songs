1. DONE -- Find a way to add optional transposition, so that we can generate PDFs in
   both the original key and a transposed key.
   
   * Added a list of transpositions in Tupfile.lua. These are then used to 
     create additional files.


2. Find a way to get proper spacing between columns in a multi-column chart.

   * It seems best to do manual line breaking. This does depend on the font
     type and size, but the lines really should be broken on bar lines or
     phrases, which is not visible in the Chordii file.


3. DONE -- Better font and layout choices (etc) for Chordii

   * Title should be bold
   * Comments (eg Verse) should be bold, rather than highlighted using
     grey.
   * Slightly more space between chords and words.
   * Slightly less space between lines.

   Use ChordPro rather than Chordii. The 'modern3' style gives a nice looking
   result.
   
4. Some songs are incomplete -- they have the word 'incomplete' in the title.
   There are about 45 of them, out of about 115.
   
   I have been through the first 10 or so songs and finished them. But there are lots more to do...

5. DONE -- Better spacing between chord symbols.

   * Use ChordPro, which give better spacing between chord symbols.
