{t:My Tennessee Mountain Home}
{st:Dolly Parton}
  
[C]Sitting on the front porch on a [F]summer after-[C]noon
In a straight back chair on two legs [G7]leaned against the [C]wall
Watch the kids all playing with [F]June bugs on a [C]string
And chase the glowing fireflies when the [G7]evening shadows [C]fall

{c:Chorus:}
{soc}
In my Tennessee [F]mountain home 
[C]Life is as peaceful as a [G7]baby's [C]sigh
In my Tennessee [F]mountain home 
[C]Crickets sing in the [G7]fields near-[C]by
{eoc}

Honeysuckle vines cling to the [F]fence along the [C]lane
Its fragrance makes the [G7]summer wind so [C]sweet
And on a distant hilltop an [F]eagle spreads its [C]wings
And a song bird on the fence post [G]sings a melo-[C]dy

{c:Chorus}

Walking home from church on Sunday [F]with the one you [C]love
Just laughing, talking, [G7]making future [C]plans
And when the folks ainâ€™t looking you might [F]steal a kiss or [C]two
Sitting in the [G7]porch swing, holding [C]hands

{c:Chorus}
