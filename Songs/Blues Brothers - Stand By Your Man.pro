[G]Sometimes it's hard to be a [D]woman,
[Am]giving all your [D7]love to just one [G]man.
[C]You'll have bad times, and he'll have [G]good times,
[A]doing things that [A7]you don't under[D]stand.[D7]

[G]But if you love him you'll for[D]give him,
[Am]even though he's [D7]hard to under[G]stand.
[C]And if you love him, oh be [G]proud of him,
[G]'cause after all he's [D7]just a [G]man. [C]  [G]  [D]

[G]Stand by your [B7]man, 
[C]give him two arms to cling to,
[G]and somthing [E]warm to come to,
[A]when the nights are [D7]cold and lonely.
[G]Stand by your [B7]man,
[C]and tell the world you love him,
[G]keep giving [D7]all the love you [B7]can.  [E]
[C]Stand [D]by your [G]man. [C]  [G]  [D]
