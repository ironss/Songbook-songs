{soh}A{eoh} / / / | {soh}F#m{eoh} / / | {soh}D{eoh} / / / | {soh}E{eoh} / / / 

When the [A]night has come
And the [F#m]land is dark
And the [D]moon is the [E]only light we'll [A]see
Well I [A]won't be afraid
No I [F#m]won't be afraid
Just as [D]long as you [E]stand, stand by [A]me

{c:Chorus:}
{soc}
[A]So darling, darling, stand by me
Oh [F#m]stand by me
Oh [D]stand, [E]stand by [A]me
Stand by me
{eoc}

If the [A]sky that we look upon
Should [F#m]tumble and fall
Or the [D]mountain should [E]crumble in the [A]sea
I won't [A]cry, I won't cry
No I [F#m]won't shed a tear
Just as [D]long as you [E]stand, stand by [A]me

{c:Chorus}
