Notes for song formatting

Notes for how to format ChordPro songs for

* Songbook (Android)
* Chordii (Linux)
* ChordPro (Linx, Windows, etc).

Different programs handle the input slightly differently.





Chord spacing
=============
Chordii does not provide enough space where the chord name would overlap
the next chord, because the words in that region are too short for the
length of the chord name. It smashes the following chord up to the
previous chord.

SongBook handles this a bit better.

ChordPro handles this better, similar to SongBook


Style
=====

1. Use {c:Verse 1}, {c:Verse 2}, {c:Chorus}, {c:Pre-chorus}, {c:Intro}

2. Include a colon after the section name when writing out the music in full.

3. Do not include a colon after after the section name to indicate that you
   must repeat that section

4. Use {c:Chorus} and {soc}/{eoc} to mark the chorus

5. When a chord change happens part way through a word, include a hyphen at
   that point in the word.
