{t:When I Survey - Thank You for the Cross - keychange}

{c:Verse 1:}
When I sur-[D]vey the [G]wondrous [D]cross
On which the [Bm]Prince [G] of glory [A]died
My richest [D/F#]gain [G] I count but [Bm]loss [G]
And pour con-[D]tempt [G] on [A/C#]all my [D]pride

[D] [-] [G] [-] [Bm] [-] [D]

{c:Verse 2:}
Forbid it Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Chirst my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them too His blood

{c:Verse 3:}
See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 

[B]

{c:Verse 4:}
Were the whole [E]realm of [A]nature [E]mine,
That were a [C#m]present [A]far too [B]small;
Love so a-[E/G#]maz-[A]-ing, so di-[C#m]vine, [A]
Demands my [E]soul, [A] my [B/D#]life, my [E]all.

{c:Bridge:}
[D]Thank You for the cross, I [G]thank You for the cross,
I [D/F#]thank You for the cross, my [G]Lord
I [D]love You for the cross, I [G]love You for the cross,
I [D/F#]love You for the cross, my [G]Lord  (x2)

{c:Instrumental:}
[D] [-] [G] [-] [Bm] [-] [D]
