{t:O Holy Night}

{c:Verse 1:}
[A]O holy night, the [D]stars are brightly [A]shining
It is the [A]night of our [E]dear saviour's [A]birth.
Long lay the world in [D]sin and error [A]pining
Till he [C#m]appeared and the [G#7]soul felt its [C#m]worth.

A [E7]thrill of hope, the [A]weary world rejoices
For [E7]yonder breaks a [A]new and glorious morn

{c:Chorus:}
[F#m]Fall on you [C#m]knees
O [Bm]hear the angel [F#m]voices
O [A]night [E7] [A]divine, [D]O [A]night [E7]when Christ was [A]born
O [A]night [E7/D] [A]divine, [D]O [A]night, [E7/D]O night [A]divine
