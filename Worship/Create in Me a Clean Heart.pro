{t:Create in Me a Clean Heart}
{st:Keith Green}

Cre[G]ate in me a [D]clean heart, [G]oh God, [G]
and renew a right [D]spirit within [C]me.   [G]

[C]Cast me not a[D]way from Thy [G]presence, oh [Em]Lord
and [C]take not Thy [D]Holy Spirit from [G]me   [G7]
Re[C]store unto [D]me the [G]joy of [Em]Thy sal[Em]vation,  [C]
and renew a right [D]spirit within [G]me.
