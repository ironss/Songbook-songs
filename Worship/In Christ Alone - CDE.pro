{c:Verse 1:}
In [F]Christ a-[C]lone, my [F]hope is [G]found
[C/E]He is my [F]light, my [G]strength, my [C]song
This [F]corner-[C]stone, this [F]solid [G]ground
[C/E]Firm through the [F]fiercest [G]drought and [C]storm

What [C/E]heights of [F]love, what [C/E]depths of [G]peace
When [C/E]fears are [F]stilled, when [C/E]strivings [G]cease!
My [F]comfort-[C]er, my [F]all in [G]all
[C/E]Here in the [F]love of [G]Christ I [C]stand.

{c:Verse 2:}
In [G]Christ a-[D]lone, who [G]took on [A]flesh
[D/F#]Fullness of [G]God in [A]helpless [D]babe
This [G]gift of [D]love, and [G]righteous-[A]ness
[D/F#]Scorned by the [G]ones He [A]came to [D]save

Till [D/F#]on the [G]cross, Christ [D/F#]Jesus [A]died
The [D/F#]wrath of [G]God was [D/F#]satis-[A]fied
For [G]every [D]sin, on [G]Him was [A]laid
[D/F#]Here in the [G]death of [A]Christ I [D]live

{c:Verse 3:}
There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again!

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I amd His and He is mine - 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

{c:Verse 4:}
No [A]guilt in [E]life, no [A]fear in [B]death
[E/G#]This is the [A]power of [B]Christ in [E]me
From [A]life's first [E]cry to [A]final [B]breath
[E/G#]Jesus com-[A]mands my [B]desti-[E]ny

No [E/G#]power of [A]hell, no [E/G#]scheme of [B]man
Can [E/G#]ever [A]pluck me [E/G#]from His [B]hand
Till [A]He re-[E]turns or [A]calls me [B]home
[E/G#]Here in the [A]power of [B]Christ I'll [E]stand!
