{t:Made to Worship}
{st:Chris Tomlin}

{c:Verse 1:}
Be[G]fore the day, Before the [D/F#]light
Be[Em]fore the world revolved around the [C]sun
God [G] on high, Stepped [D/F#]down into time
And [Em]wrote the story of His love for every[C]one

{c:Pre-chorus:}
[C] He has filled our [D]hearts with wonder
[C] So that we [D]always remember [C/D]

{c:Chorus:}
You [G] and I were made to worship,
You [C] and I are called to love
You [Am] and I are forgiven and free [D]
You [G] and I embrace surrender,
You [C] and I choose to believe
You [Am] and I will see [D]who we were meant to be [G]

{c:Verse 2:}
All we are, and all we have
Is all a gift from God that we receive
Brought to life, we open up our eyes
To see the majesty and glory of the King

{c:Bridge:}
And [Am] even the rocks [G/B] cry out
And even the heavens [C] shout
At the sound of His ho[D]ly name
So [Am] let every voice sing out [G/B]
And let every knee bow down [C]
He is worthy of [D] all our praise.
