{t:When I Survey the Wondrous Cross}

[F]When I [C]sur-[F]vey [C]the-[F]e [Bb]won-[F]drou-[C]ous [F]cross
[F]On which the [Bb]Prince [F]o-[C]of [G7]glo-[Am7]ry-[Dm]y [C] died,
[Dm]My rich-[C/E]est [F]gain [C]I-[F]I [Gm]count [F]bu-[C]ut [F]loss
[F]And pour con-[C]tempt [Dm]on [Gm7]all [F]my-[C]y [F]pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
