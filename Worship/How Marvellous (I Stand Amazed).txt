{t:How Marvellous (I Stand Amazed)}
{st:Ben Cantelon}

[G]I stand amazed in the presence
[D]Of Je-[C2]sus [G]the Nazarene,
[C2]And wonder [G/B]how He could love me,
[G]A sin-[D]ner, [G]condemned, unclean.

{c:Chorus:}
{soc}
[G]How marvellous! How wonderful!
[D]And my song shall ever be:
[G]How marvellous! [D/F#]How wonder-[Em7]ful!
[Am7]Is my [G/B]Saviour's [Dsus]love [D]for [G]me!
{eoc}

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.

{c:Chorus}

And when the ransomed in Glory
His face they at last shall see
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me
