{t:How Great Is Our God}

The [A]splendour of a King
[F#m]Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth re-[D]joice
All the earth re-[D]joice

He [A]wraps Himself in light,
And [F#m]darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His [D]voice
Trembles at His [D]voice

{c:Chorus:}
{soc}
How [A]great is our God, (sing with me)
How [F#m] great is our God, (and all will see)
How [D] great, how [E]great is our [A]God
{eocd}

[A]Age to age He stands
And [F#m]time is in His hands
Beginning and the [D]end
Beginning and the [D]end

The [A]Godhead Three in One
[F#m]Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the [F#m]Lamb
The Lion and the [F#m]Lamb

{c:Chorus}
