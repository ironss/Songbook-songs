{t:When I Survey - Thank You for the Cross}

{c:Verse 1:}
When I sur-[C]vey the [F]wondrous [C]cross
On which the [Am]Prince [F] of glory [G]died
My richest [C/E]gain [F] I count but [Am]loss
And pour [C]contempt [F] on [G]all my [C]pride

[C] [-] [F] [-] [Am] [-] [C]

{c:Verse 2:}
See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

{c:Verse 3:}
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

{c:Bridge:}
[C]Thank You for the cross, I [F]thank You for the cross,
I [C/E]thank You for the cross, my [F]Lord
I [C]love You for the cross, I [F]love You for the cross,
I [C/E]love You for the cross, my [F]Lord  (x2)

[C] [-] [F] [-] [Am] [-] [C]
