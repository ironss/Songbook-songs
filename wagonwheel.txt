{c:Verse 1}
[G]Headed down south to the [D]land of the pines
I'm [Em]thumbin' my way into [C]North Caroline
[G]Starin' up the road and [D]pray to God I see [C]headlights
I [G]made it down the coast in [D]seventeen hours,
[Em]pickin' me a bouquet of [C]dogwood flowers
and I'm a [G]hopin' for Raleigh, I can [D]see my baby to[C]night

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
So [G]rock me mama like a [D]wagon wheel,
[Em]Rock me mama any [C]way you feel
[G]Hey, [D]  mama [C]rock me
[G]Rock me mama like the [D]wind and the rain
[Em]Rock me mama like a [C]south-bound train

[c:Verse 2}
[G]Running from the cold [D]up in New England
I was [Em]born to be a fiddler in an [C]old time string band
My [G]baby plays the guitar, I [D]pick a banjo [C]now.
Oh the [G]north country winters keep a [D]getting me and I (down),
Lost my [Em]money playing poker so I [C]had to up and leave (leave town)
But I [G]ain't a turning back to [D]living that old life [C]no more.

[c:Chorus}

{c:Verse 3}
[G]Walking to the south, [D]out of Roanoke
I caught a [Em]trucker out of Philly, had a [C]nice long toke.
But [G]he's a heading west from the [D]Cumberland Gap,
to [C]Johnson City, Tennessee.
Now I [G]gotta get a move on [D]before the sun.
I hear my [Em]baby calling my name and I [C]know that she's the only one
And [G]if I die in Raleigh, at [D]least I will die [C]free.

{c:Chorus}
